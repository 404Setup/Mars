# Mars
> **WARNING: This is not for regular users**

A super lightweight clone of [api.papermc.io](https://api.papermc.io)

Lightweight does not mean incomplete functionality. On the contrary, Mars has fully implemented all the APIs of bibliothek and further optimized them.

Mars is 1:1 compatible with the bibliothek API (except for database construction and private APIs). You can seamlessly switch to Marsã€‚

## Build
> Build scripts are only useful if cross-platform builds are required.
> 
> To use the build script, you must install the Zig toolchain and PowerShell 7.

Prerequisites for building Mars:
- GCC or clang
- ZigCC (Replacement for gcc and clang, included in the zig toolchain)
- Golang 1.24.3
- PowerShell 7 (No installation required if you don't use the build script)

### Manual build

@Bash
```shell
export CGO_ENABLED=1
go mod tidy
go build -ldflags "-s -w"
```

@CMD
```shell
set CGO_ENABLED=1
go mod tidy
go build -ldflags "-s -w"
```

@PowerShell
```shell
$env:CGO_ENABLED=1
go mod tidy
go build -ldflags "-s -w"
```

### Using build scripts
> Note that the Mars build script requires PowerShell 7 and the Zig toolchain to be installed.
>
> The build script is suitable for cross-compilation.
> 
> The first build will be slow, please be patient.

```shell
./build.ps1
```
